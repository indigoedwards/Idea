# Idea (Indigo's double excitation assembler)
![alt text](http://135.181.87.229/w/images/6/65/Idea_logo.png)
----------------------------
A python program for all your one dimentional double excitation needs :D

Idea is mainly based on iDEA https://github.com/iDEA-org/iDEA

----------------------------
<h1>Functionality</h1>
Idea has three main functions: Plotting a potential, finding a double excitation (when far apart), and assembling a double excitation state by moving electrons togehter.
Idea is completely flexable for these tasks, it will take any potential as inputs and (might) still work! wow!

----------------------------
<h1>Progress</h1>
Right now Idea doesnt work, we havnt finished making it yet



----------------------------
<h1>weeeeeee</h1>
